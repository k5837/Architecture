1. Energy and environmental performance 
As part of the building, AF are associated with multiple environ mental variables. In this category, we classifified energy 
and carbon emissions related aspects that get inflfluenced by, or interact with, the façade design. This includes 
operational or embodied energy and carbon for AF. AF systems directly inflfluence the building in door environment and 
have an impact on the cooling and heating loads. The underlying building physics of AF systems in relation to building 
energy performance and envelope life cycle assessment is one of the KPIs for AF. The logic behind this category is to 
group the variables that quantify the façade’s environmental impact and performance. 
2. Protective performance 
The following set of KPIs is the protective performance of AF. Inspired by the defifinition of Herzog et al. [34] we grouped 
all per formance aspects related to structural stability and safety, together with construction related criteria under this 
category. The underlying building physics and material science of AF systems takes into account fifire resistance and 
structural performance next to acoustic and visual performance. This includes water and air permeability and the 
radiation properties for natural lighting and solar control.The logic behind this category is to group the variables that 
justify the façade’s function and stability from a user point of view. 
3. Building control and services 
The interaction between HVAC systems and the AF that takes place to assure comfort is the third category. Under this 
group we address the four types of comfort, in direct relation with building management systems and façade controls. 
The management and interaction through automated and smart technologies is based on a set of variables that fifits 
under this category. Building services including mechanical ventilation and active systems and their direct control to 
achieve indoor comfort are grouped under this category. The logic behind this category is to group the variables that 
relate to active control of the building services in relation to the façade and indoor comfort requirements. 
4. User control and experience 
The fourth KPI category, groups variables related to occupant control and engagement. The subjective perception on the 
indoor environment of users in relation to their ability to act and engage with the façade to regulate their living or working 
environment is grouped under this category. The logic behind this category is to group the variables that quantify 
occupant control and engagement with the façade within the indoor environment. 
5. Maintenance, durability and life cycle 
The fififth group of KPIs collects the variables related to time. As pects related to the life of the façade during operation 
are grouped in this category including maintenance, replacement, cleaning and durability. This category also includes 
cost-related parameters and end of life cycle or guarantee issues. The logic behind this category is to group the 
variables that maintain the façade performance, components and elements.
